#### With highlighting
Highlighting codes for each coding language
```py

```


## Tables

## Footnotes
Dette funket jo veldig dÃ¥rlig!

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: To add line breaks within a footnote, prefix new lines with 2 spaces.
  This is a second line.
